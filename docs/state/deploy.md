# Deploy lane — state

## Web server (nginx on the VPS)
- The vhost is repo-managed: `deploy/frankendom.com.conf` is the source of truth. `scripts/provision.sh` copies it to
  `/etc/nginx/sites-available/frankendom.com` on `root@49.12.7.18`, runs `nginx -t`, rolls back to the previous copy on failure,
  and reloads. Nothing about the server is configured by hand on the box; change the file, merge, run `scripts/provision.sh`.
- Site root is `/var/www/frankendom/current` (a symlink `scripts/deploy.sh` flips per release); `release.json` and `/assets/` are
  served straight from it.
- Short share links (2026-09-22, beta): `location ^~ /s/ { try_files /index.html =404; }` — `GET /s/<anything>` serves the app's
  `index.html` (no cache), the client reads the id from the path. `/assets/` and `release.json` are unaffected. Verify with
  `curl -sI https://frankendom.com/s/1a` → `200`, `content-type: text/html`.
