// The kill-link guard (owner 2026-09-22, via Strategy): a shared link replays a recorded fight by stepping this build's sim over the
// recorded intents. If any sim-deciding file changes without RECORD_VERSION changing with it, every link minted before the change
// replays a different fight and dies mid-play — which is what the viewer page's "Recorded on an older build" freeze exists to catch
// after the fact. This test catches it before the merge: it hashes the files that decide how a fight plays and pins the digest next
// to the version. Change one of them and this test fails; the fix is to bump RECORD_VERSION in src/record.ts (old links are then
// refused cleanly at decode) and paste the digest the failure prints into SIM_DIGEST below.
