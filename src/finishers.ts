// What the runtime uses: nothing here. The game keys on the event — `view.finishPhase().complete` in src/scene.ts, which

// rest). This table exists so Web can budget a layout against a real figure instead of a guessed delay, and so a drift in
// the ceremony shows up as a changed number here rather than as a panel that lands too early.
//
// How they were measured: `node scripts/finisher-preview.mjs --label finisher-durations --durations`, which plays each
// outcome's REAL captured kill window frame by frame on the production path and records the frame the scene's own latch
// fires on. Measured 2026-09-22 on the Veteran (the harness's default rig, seeds 731–748; The Quiet One is out of the
// automatic rotation, so its window is the dev picker's own path on a real kill, as the harness labels it). Receipt:
// `artifacts/character/finisher-durations/finisher-durations.json`. Re-measure with that command when a clip, the camera
// or the finisher clock changes — the harness asserts the latch fires and agrees with the scene's own finish age.
