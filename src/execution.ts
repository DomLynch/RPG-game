// Execution: a paired finisher (Death_Execution on the victim, Fin_Execution on the killer), GAME_SPEC's "the one ceremonial beat: a held
// half-second before the blow lands". The victim is forced to his knees and turned away, his weapon let go; the killer steps in behind him,
// raises the blade and HOLDS it; one downward cut to the nape; he pitches forward onto his face. Presentation only, beside Hamstrung for the same
// reason (finishers.ts and roster.ts are in the kill-link guard's digest): the pick is unchanged and NOT in ROTATION, only the dev picker plays it.

// The authored beats, shared by the offline clip build (scripts/build-execution.mjs) and the runtime. Fractions of `duration` (authored seconds).
// The scene paces the clip at `speed` (the spec's 0.75x for a cinematic finisher), so the scene lasts duration / speed seconds. The held half-second is
// baked INTO the clips and the finisher clock: both rigs hold one pose from `raise` to `release` while the clock keeps running (no frame-loop hit-stop: the
// 220 ms Killed hit-stop stays the only owner of the impact pause), and `hold` is on-screen seconds.
