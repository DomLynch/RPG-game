// docs/briefs/specials/centurion-l8-l10-2026-10-01.md, Dom's pick). Presentation only, like nightfall-fx.ts beside it: it reads the sim's special
// events and the fighters' Head bones, never the sim, a rig or Math.random (every "random" is an index hash, so a frame is a pure function of the
// clock). No horse and no prop: a LOW line of sand-coloured dust races along the ground (knee height at most) with a hoof-strike puff kicked up
// every stride behind the front, reaches the target on the landing tick (the blow) and breaks once over his feet, gone ~0.5 s later. The
// caster stands where the sim keeps him; the line comes up out of the far side of him, so he reads as arriving out of it.
// Painted and irregular: every puff is its own churned blot at its own turn and size, none a perfect disc, a lit top over a darker shadowed
// underside. Semi-transparent and low, so it never hides both fighters; no glow, nothing additive. Hoof sound is Audio's (CUE_AT).
