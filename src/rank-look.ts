// Rank looks on the opponent (docs/briefs/tier-looks-runtime.md, Strategy's streaming ruling): the fight opens on his base look (his
// fighter GLB + his carriers cut), and the rank look streams in only after first playable, then swaps on at the first idle beat, as one
// change, never mid-exchange, never in a finisher or the kill-cam. A look that lands late waits for the next idle beat; one that lands after
// the fight ends waits for the next fight (the swap stays armed). A look that fails to load leaves him in his base look, not the fight.
//
// Shipping looks (Lead, 2026-09-28): the Goblin met at rank level 2–10 wears L2–L10 (public/looks/goblin-L<n>.glb, Armour's packed4 files,
// each through the stream gate's rules); at level 1 he is his rig as shipped. The Plague Doctor the same, L2–L10 (Dom via Strategy/Lead,
// 2026-09-28: GPT's rank pack, packed by Armour to the look caps). The Knight the same, L2–L10 (Dom 18:2x via Strategy/Lead, 2026-09-28:
// GPT's pack at Strategy's 70k armour tris, Armour's packed files; two skinned draws, armour + gauntlets, on his rig's own joints).
// The Nightborn the same, L2–L10 (Dom 19:0x via Strategy/Lead): his built rig's 14 draws all go off (keep = []), the file is his whole
// fitted figure with its own head (L8–L10: the closed helm), his estoc stays.
// The Dwarf the same, L2–L10 (Dom 20:1x via Strategy/Lead): his CreatureBody and his two helmet draws go off (keep = []), his warhammer
// stays; GPT's known defects (pale L9 underarm, rough fingers, shoulder seams, plate rims) ship as delivered on Dom's word.
// The Witch the same, L2–L10 (Dom 2026-09-29 via Strategy: "witch is done now, check and integrate into game"): every one of her draws
// goes off (keep = []), the file is her whole fitted figure (L8–L10: the closed helm), her stock trident stays (Weapons' override); GPT's
// known defects (L4/L5 face fragments) ship as delivered. She has no finishers (roster finishers: []), so no waist-cut bake is ever taken.
// The Pitborn (Dom GO via Lead, 2026-09-29): L2–L10, full + phone, Armour's handover-l2l10 from GPT's pack, shipped as delivered. His
// built rig's 16 draws and his carriers go off under a keep = [] look; his cleaver stays. L8–L10 carry a split closed helm (Head 1.0).
// The Centurion (id veteran, Lead 2026-09-29): L2–L5 + L7–L10, full + phone, Armour's handover-l2l10 from GPT's pack, shipped as delivered.
// L6 is not in his set (GPT's L6 is a static Sand Legionary with no rig): that rank keeps his base rig. His CreatureBody, helmet and face
// draws go off under a keep = [] look; his weapon stays.
// The Shieldmaiden (Dom GO via Lead, 2026-09-29): L2–L10, full + phone, Armour's handover-l2l10 from GPT's pack, shipped as delivered.
// Her draws and carriers go off under a keep = [] look; her shield carrier (a Shield slot) and her drawn gladius stay.
// The Plague Doctor L1 "Recruit" (Dom 2026-09-30 via Lead, "integrate and get live"; the template for every opponent's new L1): GPT's
// delivery repacked to his L2 file's shape (garment + gloves only; the hidden original body, the longsword draws and the clips dropped), full +
// phone.
// The Executioner (Dom GO via Strategy/Lead, 2026-09-29): L2–L10, full + phone, Armour's handover-l2l10 from GPT's pack, shipped as
// delivered (L2–L7 open hood keeps GPT's weights). His draws and carriers go off under a keep = [] look; his scythe (trunk's) stays.
// The Executioner L1 "Recruit" (Strategy 2026-09-30, Dom "accelerate all"): GPT's selected delivery (HF revision 88e23e07, sha256 605d9b2a)
// as delivered, one draw (his hidden L2 shells and the unskinned scythe copies dropped; his trunk scythe stays); the phone simplifies the garment.
// The Dwarf L1 "Recruit" (Dom 2026-09-30 via Lead, "switch it and get live"): GPT's patched-linen recruit on his ORIGINAL body (head and
// beard his own), neckline repaired by Armour (hidden neck skin restored under the collar, donor-beard texels trimmed from the tunic). The full
// file ships GPT's maps and mesh as delivered (Strategy 2026-09-30, AAA ask; check-budget DESKTOP_LOOK_SET); only the -phone file is rebaked
// like his L2 (body + tunic in one 1024 atlas, tunic 24k tris).
// The Nightborn L1 "Recruit" (Strategy 2026-09-30, Dom's AAA-quality ask): the full is GPT's mesh + maps as delivered (only its two PNGs
// re-encoded to LOSSLESS webp, pixel-identical; Armour); the phone is his L2-phone recipe, one rebaked 1024 atlas.
// The Pitborn L1 "Recruit" (Lead 2026-09-30, Weapons on loan): GPT's delivery packed by Hero Look at GPT quality (q88, 1024, no trim; face,
// bone and his original helm steel + wrap kept, keep = []), full + phone; his full file has its own desktop cap (check-budget DESKTOP_LOOK_SET).
// The Plague Doctor's costume is fused into CreatureBody, so his files keep nothing of his (extras.keep = []): the look is the whole fitted figure. No other opponent has one until his files pass the gate. The
// dev flag `?ranklook=/looks/<name>.glb` streams a same-origin file directly under /looks/ onto whichever opponent the page fights (a file
// built for another rig simply does not fit), over the table.
