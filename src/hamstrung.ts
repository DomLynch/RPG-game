// digest (tests/record-version-guard.test.ts SIM_FILES): wiring it there would force a RECORD_VERSION bump for a change the
// simulation never sees. The pick is unchanged (it is NOT in ROTATION): only the dev picker plays it.

// another rig (goblin, nightborn) or a held creature keeps the plain death. minotaur.glb and wraith.glb also carry a Death_Hamstrung of their own
