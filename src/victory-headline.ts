// LOOK TEST behind `?look=headline` (default OFF; Strategy research #49, owner queue item 1): one earned line on the win, read from the fight's own event log.
// Presentation only: no sim, record or reward change, no badge, no rank, no damage bonus. Pure: no DOM. The player is side 0; a Hit/GuardBroken names its attacker
// as `actor`, a Blocked/Parried names the defender as `actor`, a PostureBroken names the broken fighter as `target` (src/duel.ts).
// Numbers over adjectives; nothing earned means nothing said (the autopsy's rule, src/autopsy.ts). The first that holds wins:
