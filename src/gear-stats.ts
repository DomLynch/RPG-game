// Gear stats (brief 19, deliverable 1): what a kit is worth, as two multipliers. Data only — nothing here changes a fight yet, and
// `src/loot.ts`'s "visual cosmetics only, no stats" header stands until deliverable 5 puts a Loadout into `stepDuel`.
//
// TWO stats, not four, and the boundary is the point. `docs/progression-direction.md` (owner, 2026-09-19) puts POISE, health (VIG) and
// stamina (END/DEX) in the Origin CHARACTER layer, and has the heavy armour classes COSTING stamina economy rather than granting it.
// So gear carries Attack and RES and nothing else. The first cut of this file had gear granting Poise and a bigger stamina pool, which
// would have put the gear layer in direct contradiction with the character layer before either shipped.
//
// The seam this file is built for: the simulation takes a `Loadout` — the resolved multipliers — and never sees a tier, a slot or a
// table. That is why this module is deliberately NOT in eslint.config.js's SIM list and never needs to be: the resolution happens
// once, outside the duel, and only its results cross the boundary. It also keeps `src/duel.ts` free of any import of `loot.ts` or
// `grades.ts`, which the sim-boundary test would refuse.
//
// The bar (brief 19): gear tilts, skill decides. A full Origin set moves either stat by at most 20% against no gear, so a naked
// fighter can still beat every rung under its fairness cap. And **no stat changes the timing of any attack, parry, roll or wind-up** —
// a longsword tell is a longsword tell at every tier — which is why every number here is a damage multiplier and none is a duration.
// The caps below are the whole of that promise and `tests/gear-stats.test.ts` holds them exactly.

// A record of multipliers rather than a fixed pair by design: brief 19 asks for a shape the Origin character layer EXTENDS rather than
// replaces. That layer resolves item ids plus an approved allocation into the same kind of object, and its stats join as further
// fields without this table changing.
export type { Loadout } from './duel.ts';   // the sim owns the shape (deliverable 5): the seam's input, so duel.ts imports nothing from here

// table below plus `levelOf` IS the 10 × 7 grid; `tests/gear-stats.test.ts` pins every one of its cells so a weight cannot be nudged
// without the grid saying so.
//
// Recruit is the identity and that is a design decision, not an off-by-one (Strategy, 2026-09-22, overriding this lane's first cut,
// which had rags at a tenth of a cap). Brief 14's Recruit is rag & scrap on 2 of 6 slots — salvage, not armour — and the naked bracket
// is only a real guarantee if the new player actually standing in rags is inside it. So Legionary leather is the first tilt in the game,
// and a Recruit fights on skill alone with nothing subtracted.
//
// The weights are a judgement about how much of a fighter each slot actually covers, and they are mine (Stats lane, 2026-09-22), not
// inherited from a brief: the tunic is the largest area and the legs the next, the head is small but is where the kill lands, and the
// gloves are the least armour a man wears. They sum to 100 so that a full set is exactly one whole cap and no constant is fitted.
//
// The Crest is 0 and that is the design, not an omission: brief 19 says it carries nothing, because it is a mark of rank and not
// armour. It stays in the table rather than being left out so that every armour slot resolves, and 0 reads as a decision.
// The Shield is 0 and that is Dom's decision, not a placeholder and not the Crest's reason repeated. Brief 19 Addendum C item 3
// (2026-09-23): the shield is the GUARD PROFILE only — two sides covered, stops heavies, cheaper hold, posture drains faster while
// held — with "no flat incoming reduction", and his earlier "−20 % incoming" withdrawn because one shield at Recruit would equal the
// whole Origin armour cap and stack to 36 %. A RES weight here would BE that withdrawn reduction, reinstated in a table. The shield
