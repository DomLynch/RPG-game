// picks freely, never a timing change (no swing speed, parry window, i-frames, reach or input). Each entry is a signed per-mille delta on ONE quantity, read at its site in src/duel.ts through
// `stanced`, exactly as a patron perk is (`perked`): a fighter with no stance (Neutral) takes the unscaled value untouched, so no float drift and a stance-less fight is byte for byte as before.
// A sim file: no Math.random, no clock, no transcendental. The numbers are Dom's table; the damage delta starts at +-5% (Lead), his +-10% is the ceiling the battery may raise it to.
