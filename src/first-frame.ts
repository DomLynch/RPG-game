// 3005 ms, pitborn 2259 ms, setfoot 3242 ms). Here the maps go up a slice per frame, then one whole draw, all before the card may lift; a slow device
// stops uploading after `budgetMs` and the card lifts anyway (the rest of the warm-up is dropped). Pixels are untouched: the draw is what the first frame was.
