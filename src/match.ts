// The match session (Lead (b) 2026-09-22, the GPT audit's one structural gap): the single owner of the fight's state and of every
// start, end and reset. main.ts wires the DOM, the renderer and the frame loop to this; nothing here touches the document, the
// network, a timer or the renderer, so tests/match.test.ts drives every mode through this same code.
// Four modes, explicit (the daily duel was removed: Dom 2026-09-29, "way over-complicated"):
//   career   — the ladder fight: the trial line, the scorecard row, one career mark and the loot offer on a win.
//   practice — a kill link's PLAY NOW: recorded, replayable, nothing awarded (avenged, not scored).
//   replay   — a kill link playing back: the record's own intents, no recorder, no AFK mark, nothing awarded.
//   sparring — an admin's test fight (src/sparring.ts, Dom 2026-09-26): any warden, level, weapon and move for this fight only; no recorder,
//              so no record, no share and no post, and nothing awarded or written (no trial line, no scorecard row, no mark).
//   pvp      — a live duel against another player (src/net/pvp.ts, docs/duel-architecture.md): the page's driver steps both men and hands
//              back this side's view; no recorder here (the rollback session keeps both streams) and nothing awarded (src/net/rewards.ts).
// Every reset goes through begin(): adding a piece of match state means clearing it in one place, not six.
