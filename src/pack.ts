// Two pure pieces, both OUTSIDE SIM_FILES like src/mobkit.ts and src/twist.ts: they read a Duel and build the next one from existing exports, they write nothing back into the sim, so no RECORD_VERSION.
//  1. A camp is a SEQUENCE of ordinary Pit bouts against the same player (`startPack`, `nextBout`): the player's fighter (health, stamina, posture, wound, cooldowns) carries over untouched, the next member walks in
//     from the play circle's far edge, the leader enters last. Waiting members are presentation only, not in the sim.
//  2. The creature's THREAT LIST (`ThreatList`): who the creature turns on when several players hit it. Donor: AzerothCore ThreatManager (damage adds threat; the current victim changes only when another beats it
//     by 110 %, casters 130 %; a list cap of 7; suppressed targets are used only when no online one is left). Deterministic: a pure function of the join order and the damage stream, ties go to the earlier joiner.
