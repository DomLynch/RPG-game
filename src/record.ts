// The fight record (beta plan brief 3, owner 2026-09-21): one fight, replayable anywhere. A pure module — no DOM, no renderer — so a
// browser, a Node gate and a server can all record, encode, decode and (in the next slice) replay the same fight. The duel is
// deterministic given the warden's seed and the player's Intent per tick (src/duel.ts stepDuel uses no other randomness), so the
// record is exactly that: who fought, which seed, and every intent the player fed the simulation, quantized so that what the live
// game stepped and what a replay steps are the same bits.
//
// Encoding: a versioned binary (version FIRST; an unknown version is refused, never best-effort decoded) — header, then columnar
// per-tick bytes (stick x, stick z, camera-yaw delta, action, guard side, flags) — gzipped and base64url'd. Columns of mostly
// repeated or zero bytes gzip well: a 30 s fight (1,800 ticks) lands well under 2 KB (tests/record.test.ts measures a real one).
// Nothing here talks to the network; recording stays in memory until a later slice's Share.

export const RECORD_VERSION = 38;   // 38: bump 38 (2026-10-08; Combat, seamless step 3, Strategy's number) — a fight may START FROM A POSE (duel.ts DuelPose: hero and foe positions and the hero's facing, as the open world has them) instead of the pit marks. The flag byte gains bit 5 (the fight has a pose) and five float32 LE follow the patron byte (hero x, z, foe x, z, heroFacing; the writer rounds with roundPose BEFORE the fight begins so a replay starts from the same bits). ONLY a posed fight is written as v38 (the lowest-version rule: it also carries any stances/gambit/patron flags it has); every other fight keeps its version and its bytes, so REACH[38] is empty, no older link is refused and no fixture moves. 37: bump 37 (2026-10-08; Combat, the Cinder Bear, Dom: bears after the boar) — a NEW held opponent on the boar's pattern (roster.ts bear, the `bite` weapon, its own baked jaw table on src/assets/bear.glb, an archetype row): the sim files move, no existing fight does, so REACH[37] is empty and no older link is refused. The codec is unchanged. 36: bump 36 (2026-10-08; Combat, the Tusked Boar, Dom: a boar in Zone 1) — a NEW held opponent on the wolf's pattern (roster.ts boar, the `bite` weapon, its own baked jaw table on src/assets/boar.glb, an archetype row): the sim files move, no existing fight does, so REACH[36] is empty and no older link is refused. The codec is unchanged: every fight keeps its lowest version. 35: bump 35 (2026-10-07; Combat, the Ash Wolf, docs/specs/origins/mob-fights-proposal.md) — a NEW held opponent (roster.ts wolf, the `bite` weapon, its baked blade table, an archetype row): the sim files move, no existing fight does, so REACH[35] is empty and no older link is refused. The codec is unchanged: every fight keeps its lowest version (31 / 32 / 33 / 34), so no fixture moves. 34: bump 34 (2026-10-07; Combat, Dom's stances ruling, src/stance.ts) — the flag byte gains bit 2 (the fight has stances) and bits 3-4 (the player's pick: 0 neutral, 1 aggressive, 2 defensive, 3 trickster; the AI's mood is drawn from the seed, so a replay re-sims it). ONLY a stances fight is written as v34 (a Gambit-only fight still v33, a patron fight v32, the rest v31), so REACH[34] is empty and no older link is refused. 33: bump 33 (2026-10-07; Combat, Lead GO, the Gambit, src/gambit.ts) — the flag byte after the skill byte (the specials byte) gains bit 1: the fight had the Gambit (Duel.gambit, duel.ts withGambit; a second heavy press after the chamber arms it, the draw is a pure function of the record's seed). ONLY a fight with the gambit flag is written as v33; every other fight still writes 31 (no patron) or 32 (a patron) and steps exactly as before, so REACH[33] is empty and no older link is refused. 32: bump 32 (2026-10-07; Combat, patron perks, docs/specs/origins/patron-perks-sim.md) — the header carries the patron (one byte after the arena byte; Fighter.perk, duel.ts withPerks). The ceiling is 32 but a fight with NO patron still writes 31 (NO_PATRON_VERSION) and replays byte for byte as v31, so REACH[32] is empty and today's links are unchanged; only a patron fight is a v32 link, which an older build refuses. The patron table is versioned by this number: a change to a patron's perk is a new bump. 31: bump 31 (2026-10-07; Combat, Strategy + Lead: RV31, docs/specs/combat/l6-anti-spam.md) — light-spam answer: AiProfile.spamRun reads a masher EARLY (that many consecutive lights before the player has defended once; the early gate alone replaces the old read for everyone except the Shieldmaiden, who keeps spamBoth: 1) for the Veteran, Pitborn, Dwarf, Knight and Shieldmaiden at every level (ai.ts readOpponent, moves.ts OWN_KNOBS). No other opponent changes (absent = the old read), so REACH[31] names those five from level 1 and every other v30 fight replays as before. 30: bump 30 (2026-10-07; Combat, Strategy + Lead: RV30) — the Shieldmaiden, the Knight and the Plague Doctor get their own AI profile rows (moves.ts; profile numbers only, no move timing, no rule change), so REACH[30] names those three from level 1: a v29 record of theirs is refused, every other v29 fight replays exactly as before. 29: bump 29 (2026-10-07; Combat, Dom via Lead: the RV29 rule batch) — posture.hold 45 -> 60, a fighter under 30% health drains posture at half speed (2C), a heavy-class blow or kick on an exhausted fighter stuns 36 ticks longer (3B), the rear hit retuned (damage 1.25, posture x1.5, damage 1.5 in total on a hurt or posture-broken target). These rules touch EVERY fight, so REACH[29] lists every opponent from level 1: a record below 29 is refused. 28: bump 28 (2026-10-07; Combat, #1507 item 1, docs/specs/combat/interruptible-windups.md) — interruptible special casts: damage taken while a special winds up (Fighter.castHurt) cuts it at RULES.special.interruptAt of max health (SpecialInterrupted, interruptCooldown, no recovery). Only a fight with the specials flag steps differently (specials are not live; the era stamp writes older versions for headless fights, so the decoder cannot refuse by version without refusing those), and flag-off records replay exactly as before, so REACH[28] is empty. 27: bump 27 (2026-10-06; Combat, Lead GO + Dom via Strategy: the 50-level ladder) — levels 47–50 (Origin II–V) exist: the tail past hard (moves.ts tailApex, skill knobs only) and the level ceiling LEVELS 46 -> 50. Levels 1–46 are untouched (the hard anchor stays at 46), so REACH[27] is empty and every older link replays exactly as it did. 26: bump 26 (2026-10-06; World, Lead + Dom: all eleven painted arenas ride the ladder) — the header names the arena the fight was fought in (one byte after the specials flag; 0 = the ladder band, as every record up to 25). SAME SIM: only the codec changed, so REACH[26] is empty and every older link decodes and replays exactly as it did. 25: bump 25 (2026-10-07; Combat, COMBAT-001 3/3) — the Goblin's stab (AiProfile.stab: an opening he cannot cut is answered with the knife's 12-tick thrust; easy absent, normal .6, hard 1). A record's version picks it, as it picks the circle and the late notice: below FIRST_STAB_VERSION (stab-rule.ts, set by underRecord) the stab is off, so every older Goblin link replays its own fight and REACH[25] is empty. 24: bump 24 (2026-10-07, Lead; Backend, COMBAT-001) — late notice (ai.ts READ.lateNotice): on the in-between ladder levels from L12 up (moves.ts softNotice) a cut noticed with 1–5 ticks to spare is answered only (spare − 1) / 5 of the time. A record's version says whether its fight had the ramp (play-radius.ts LATE_NOTICE: v23 and older replay without it, detmath.ts underRecord, match.ts), so REACH[24] is empty and every shared link still replays its own fight. 23: bump 23 (2026-10-06, Dom via Lead) — Arena 1's play circle comes inward to 0.6 of 8.55 m (play-radius.ts; the veteran and the pitborn, every level). A record's version picks its circle: v22 and older replay in the old 8.55 m (detmath.ts underRecord, match.ts), so REACH[23] is empty and every shared link still replays its own fight. 22: bump 22 (2026-10-02; Combat, #1280, with #1114 not live) — Dom's final special rule in the sim (RULES.special: boss share .25, the cooldown re-arms from the release, a 45-tick no-attack recovery; duel.ts specialRecover). Only a fight with the specials flag steps differently, so a v21 specials record would replay another fight: 21 stays readable beside 22 (Lead: v21 is the writer on the specials base); a flag-off fight is bit for bit as v20, so v18–v20 stay readable and REACH[22] is empty.
// 21: bump 21 (2026-09-29, Dom's GO via Lead; Combat) — Special Moves on the SKILL slot (duel.ts withSpecials, RULES.special), behind a per-fight flag the header now carries (one byte after the skill). With the flag off a v21 fight steps bit for bit as v20 (every new branch reads a field only withSpecials sets), so v20 stays readable (REACH[21] is empty).
// 20: bump 20 (2026-09-28, Dom via Strategy / Lead) — the Plague Doctor fights with the estoc, not the longsword (roster.ts; his archetype row is the Nightborn's, who fights with it). REACH[20]: the Plague Doctor at every level. Inside the same unreleased bump (2026-09-29): his easy tellReaction 15 (moves.ts), closing the estoc's L6 thrust-from-range hole. And the sim's math (2026-09-29, Strategy ruling (b)): v20 on steps on src/detmath.ts (sin/cos/atan2/hypot on + − * / sqrt, the same bits in every engine; Node's V8 and Chromium's had split a Dwarf link on a 1-ulp atan2); v18/v19 records replay on the engine's own Math, frozen, picked by this version field through detmath.underRecord, so no shared link becomes a fresh fight.
// 19: bump 19 (2026-09-28, RV18 content rebased on RV19; SCOPE shield line, Lead split from RV17) — the Centurion carries gladius + scutum from Legionary (moves.ts LOADOUT_FROM, level 6 on; the Recruit keeps the trident); the scutum is a guard profile only (wide: both flanks, stops heavies, costScale .75, posture drains ×1.5).
// 18: bump 18 (2026-09-28, RV19 in the lane's numbering; Strategy ruling) — the Centurion's own knobs (moves.ts OWN_KNOBS: tellReaction 15 on the thrust and the pommel strike, braceHeavy 1): every level fights another Centurion. The Skeleton, his archetype twin, is unchanged.
// 17: bump 17 (2026-09-27, RV17; Lead ruling) — the Witch's easy SKILL fields retuned (reaction 26 -> 15, parry .05 -> .2, lapse .5 -> .35, read .5 -> .65; identity and normal / hard untouched), so levels 1–17 fight another Witch: thrust from range beat her 46–48 / 48 at L10–16.
// 16: bump 16 (2026-09-28, RV16; Dom via Strategy 2026-09-27) — the 46-level ladder: the header's profile byte carries the opponent's LEVEL (1–46, moves.ts profileAt; easy / normal / hard are levels 6 / 18 / 46), level 1 is a novice below easy, and the Witch's sweep and hop are held at every level (her normal and hard were the plain warden's). One batch with the rank / order change.
// 15: bump 15 (2026-09-26, RV15; Dom via Strategy) — Estoc Lunge and Iron Rush lose their landed-cast follow-up (moves.ts: stagger 0, staminaDamage 0; Lunge damage 11, Iron Rush 10; reach, stepIn and the Rush's poise kept), so Lunge, Iron Rush and Dirty Jab are offered again (loot.ts SKILLS). Judged at 480 seeds: under Pommel + 40 by one sd on every pairing.
//   // 14: bump 14 (2026-09-26, SCOPE 8; Dom via Strategy: all nine in one batch) — the nine opponents' skills (moves.ts `skill_lunge` … `skill_hewer`, loot.ts SKILLS), each a take a kill offers; the equipped-skill byte gains codes 3–11 (append only).
//   // 13: bump 13 (2026-09-25, one bump for two sim changes, Strategy's ruling) — the hero's day-one skill `skill_pommel` (moves.ts; Dom: "Hero starts with Pommel Strike; one skill slot; a take swaps it"), and Combat's #761: the Goblin's kick lunges at pace 1, not his 1.2 (duel.ts). A v12 Goblin fight with a kick replays a different fight, so older links are refused at decode.
// 12: bump 12 (2026-09-25, SKILL 1: docs/briefs/skill-witch-arm.md) — the SKILL action and the `skill_witchfire` move (duel.ts, moves.ts), and the player's equipped skill in the header after the weapon. A v11 record has no skill byte, so older links are refused at decode.
// 11: bump 11 (2026-09-25, the Mon 09-28 window; Dom via Strategy) — every weapon starts the fight SHEATHED (duel.ts initialDuel): since #713 a taken weapon started 'ready', so the opponent (ai.ts) never waited for the draw. A v10 record of a taken-weapon fight replays a fight with no draw beat, so older links are refused at decode.
// 10: bump 10 (2026-09-24, Dom's drive-by) — the Witch's own Easy profile (#691) and the kick-into-guard stagger 36 -> 48 (#692), one bump for both (the straight-back roll, #693, needed no sim change). Older links are refused at decode (Dom accepts). 9: bump 9 (2026-09-23) — the park habit counts the first parked tick only (ai.ts); a one-tick park used to count every later tick of its swing, so a committing parrier (Nightborn, Plague Doctor) read a parker from one sloppy tap. A sim change, so older links are refused at decode.
// 8: bump 8 (2026-09-23) — the Executioner's own normal profile (`anticipate`, #550) and the roster-v0 beta characters (Shieldmaiden, Knight, Plague Doctor, Witch) on their bodies' archetypes. A sim change, so older links are refused at decode.
// 7: Publish B (2026-09-23), one bump for the chain — the estoc's real reach (#532), the Nightborn's profile (#545), the gladius as a player weapon (#543; the Centurion's swap, #547, is held), and the knife and scythe thrust tables rebaked on their 5's timings (the bake was stale since 5; blade-paths.ts is in the digest now). A sim change, so older links are refused at decode.
// 6: the kicker-hover hold fix (2026-09-22) — a warden's hold now derives from the inReach margin of the move he has queued, so he stops parking at a gap his own plan cannot reach. A sim change, so older links are refused at decode rather than replaying a different fight.
// 5: the batched weapon-data flip (2026-09-22) — the knife's thrust recovery 15 -> 20 and the scythe's heel-jab 18 -> 30, one bump for the pair rather than one each (the lead's ruling: kill links are the viral surface, and N bumps means N waves of dead links). 4 was taken by Brief 13's whip tell while this branch was in flight, so this is 5, not the 4 the branch first wrote.
// 4: the lorarii's whip tell (`WhipRaised`, #431) adds events to the duel stream, so a record written on 3 replays a fight whose whip never rose.
// 3: the warden's reach fix (#371) and the ladder retune (#366) changed how fights play out, so a link recorded before them would replay a different fight; this build refuses every earlier version instead. 2: the player's weapon after the opponent id (2026-09-21). 1: every fight was the longsword.
// The decoder's ACCEPT-LIST: the versions this build can read. Deliberately data, and deliberately not `RECORD_VERSION` — reading
// and writing are different questions, and a build that writes one version can still read the ones whose bytes it understands. It is
// pinned as a literal in tests/record-version-guard.test.ts beside SIM_DIGEST, so widening it is a reviewed decision rather than a
// drift. There is exactly one list: scripts/verify-daily.mjs imports `decodeRecord` from this module and deploy.sh rsyncs src/**/*.ts
// to the verifier host, so the server reads this list too — a second copy on the server is the failure this shape exists to prevent.
// [5] -> [6] with the writer bump to 6 (knife hold fix, 2026-09-23). REPLACED, not widened: this build writes 6 and must read 6 back
// (the guard's own `includes(RECORD_VERSION)` assertion), and it must NOT read 5 — a v5 record replays a fight whose Goblin stood
// somewhere else. Accepting 5 again is PR B's decision, together with the v5 decode branch, exactly as before.
// [6] -> [7] with the writer bump to 7 (Publish B, 2026-09-23). REPLACED, not widened, for the same reason: a v6 record replays a fight
// whose Nightborn fought a shorter estoc on another profile.
// [7] -> [8] with the writer bump to 8: replaced, not widened (a v7 record replays an Executioner on the shared profile).
// [8] -> [9] with the writer bump to 9: replaced, not widened (a v8 record with a one-tick park replays a Nightborn who read it as a habit).
// [9] -> [10] with the writer bump to 10: replaced, not widened (a v9 record replays a Witch on the Centurion's Easy).
// [10] -> [11] with the writer bump to 11: replaced, not widened (a v10 taken-weapon record replays a fight with no draw beat).
// [11] -> [12] with the writer bump to 12: replaced, not widened (a v11 record has no skill byte in its header).
// [12] -> [13] with the writer bump to 13: replaced, not widened (a v12 Goblin fight with a kick replays a lunge at his 1.2 pace).
// [13] -> [14] with the writer bump to 14: replaced, not widened (a v13 build cannot name codes 3–11, and its fights ran on the v13 digest).
// [14] -> [15] with the writer bump to 15: replaced, not widened (a v14 Lunge or Iron Rush fight replays a 20-damage, 22-stagger landing).
// [15] -> [16] with the writer bump to 16: replaced, not widened (a v15 header names easy / normal / hard, not a level).
// [16] -> [17] with the writer bump to 17: replaced, not widened (a v16 Witch fight below level 18 replays her old easy blend).
// [18] -> [19] with the writer bump to 19: replaced, not widened (a v18 Centurion fight at L6+ replays his old trident, no scutum).
// [17] -> [18] with the writer bump to 18: replaced, not widened (a v17 Centurion fight replays his old answers to the thrust and the pommel).
// [19] -> [18, 19] (2026-09-28, Lead: kill links should not die at every bump): WIDENED, the first time. Bump 19 changed one fight, the
// Centurion from level 6 on (moves.ts LOADOUT_FROM: gladius + scutum; the rest of its diff, the scutum's wide / postureDecay fields and
// the two braceHeavy lines in ai.ts, is inert without the scutum). Every other v18 fight steps bit for bit on v19 (the PR's probe: the
// event stream, outcome, final tick and final state match, every opponent × level × weapon × strategy). A v18 record inside V18_REACH
// is still refused at decode, with the same "version" message, so the page converts it into a fight exactly as before.
// [18, 19] -> [18, 19, 20] with the writer bump to 20: widened under the standing rule (Strategy, 2026-09-28): bump 20 declares its reach
// in REACH below, and an older record is read wherever no later bump reached its fight.
// [18, 19, 20] -> [18, 19, 20, 21] with the writer bump to 21: widened, and REACH[21] is empty. Bump 21 adds Special Moves behind a flag the
// record carries; a record without the flag (every v18–v20 record) steps exactly as before, so no older fight is reached.
// [18, 19, 20, 21] -> [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] with the writer bump to 22: widened, REACH[22] is empty (Lead's ruling after the Auditer, 2026-10-02: v21 is the writer on the specials base, which may reach trunk before #1280, so it stays readable).
// [.., 22] -> [.., 22, 23] with the writer bump to 23: widened, REACH[23] is empty (the play circle is keyed on the record's version, so an older record steps in the circle it was fought in).
// [.., 23] -> [.., 23, 24] with the writer bump to 24: widened, REACH[24] is empty (late notice is keyed on the record's version, so an older record steps without the ramp).
// [.., 24] -> [.., 24, 25] with the writer bump to 25: widened, REACH[25] is empty (the stab is keyed on the record's version, so an older Goblin record steps without it).
// [.., 28] -> [.., 28, 29] with the writer bump to 29: widened, REACH[29] lists every opponent from level 1 (the posture, stun and rear rules change every fight), so only a v29 record replays.
// [.., 30] -> [.., 30, 31] with the writer bump to 31: widened, REACH[31] lists the Veteran, Pitborn, Dwarf, Knight and Shieldmaiden from level 1 (the early spammer read), so a v30 record of any other opponent still replays.
// [.., 29] -> [.., 29, 30] with the writer bump to 30: widened, REACH[30] lists the Shieldmaiden, the Knight and the Plague Doctor from level 1 (their own profile rows), so a v29 record of any other opponent still replays.
// [.., 27] -> [.., 27, 28] with the writer bump to 28: widened, REACH[28] is empty (only a specials-flag fight steps differently; flag-off records of any readable version replay exactly as before).
// [.., 31] -> [.., 31, 32] with the writer bump to 32: widened, REACH[32] is empty (a patron-less fight writes 31 and steps as before; only a patron record is v32).
