// (Dom-approved 2026-10-07); the mean equals a heavy, and the self-stagger's punish cost makes it slightly worse (condition C1). src/duel.ts applies it and origins/luck/luck.ts shows the same numbers
// on the HUD, both importing THESE, so they cannot drift. A sim file: no Math.random, no clock, no transcendental.
