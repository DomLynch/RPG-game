// The Coach on the page (TOP10 row 8, Web): the on/off toggle, the take-over on any fight press, the "Coached" tag and marker. Presentation and input routing only:
// the brain, the spans and the build string are src/coach.ts (Combat); no sim file reads anything here. ON by default as a feature; `?coach=off` is the kill switch only (Dom 2026-10-08, "keep everything ON").
// The toggle is saved per DEVICE (localStorage), the same pattern as the camera-lock chip (Lead ruling 2026-10-08); the single bit is "Coach plays", and a take-over turns it off so the chip tells the truth.
