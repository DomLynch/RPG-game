  // driving at a gap where he cannot start the thrust, and stands there. Measured on the Goblin (knife) against a kick-only knife
  // player, hard, 7200 ticks: hover 1.50, hold from 1.45, gap pinned 1.417–1.431 (p10 = median = p90 over seeds 1–3), 4–5 attack starts
  // in the whole fight, every seed a stall. His usable reaches there are light 1.10 / thrust 1.35 / heavy 1.45, so only the heavy was
  // ever legal — and the heavy needs a `guarded` read or a queued `next`, which is why two minutes bought five swings.
  // `inReach` is the one definition of "I can start this from here" (gap <= reach - .1), so the hold derives from it rather than
  // restating a distance. Math.min only ever pulls the hold IN: the kicker margin has widened once before and it cost the Goblin's
  // identity gate (kick-only cheese 2/24 -> 7/24 wins), so this clamp is one-directional by construction.

  // doing its job, and a poker's whiff is the opening that releases the hold. It is the kicker's `+ .3` lunge allowance that has no
  // such release when the sum overshoots the holder's own range.
  // Derived from the move he is actually COMMITTED to, not from the thrust. `next.next` is picked once and only re-picked when it is
  // null (`!next.wait && !next.next && canAct` above), and it is cleared by throwing the attack — so a warden held at a gap his queued
  // move cannot reach never attacks, never clears the plan, and never re-rolls it. Measured: queued `light` on 6599 of 6599 ready ticks,
  // thrust legal and in reach on 3340 of them, full stamina, no threat, and five swings in two minutes. Line ~191 has the mirror of this
  // rule for a plan that is too CLOSE (inside the blade's minReach); this is the missing far side of it.
