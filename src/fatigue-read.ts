// `?look=fatigue-read` (a look test, presentation only): the tired body made to READ from behind the hero at the 375 fight camera. The live layer
// (fatigue-layer.ts) hunches spine_01 by about 10 degrees and heaves the chest by ~3, which from behind is a foreshortened nothing; only the sword
// arm's sag shows. This pose pitches the whole spine ~34 degrees at gassed, ~15 winded (spine_01..03; measured at the fight camera: under ~25 it does not read from behind), drops the head, raises and lowers the shoulders on a slow breath
// and sinks the guard hand. Bones only: no sim state, no hitbox, no blade table; the sword arm keeps the live layer's sag. No flag = fatigueLayer alone.
// Reads `Fatigue.level` (band 1 starts at .5; w is 0 at .2, 1 at .85, so stamina 10 -> level .9 is full), `gassed` (forces full) and `second`
// (the second wind straightens it), via the `tired` value characters.ts already holds (fed by scene.ts from practice.fatigue[side]).
