// run through the verbatim copies duel-open.ts / ai-open.ts / sim-open.ts by the adapter open-fight.ts; this file owns only what the Pit has no word for: who is in whose fight (aggro, the nearest foe, the hold-off ring
// for the rest of a pack), the chase to that ring, leash, give-up, heal-home, the creature rows (`creature`, levels from moves.ts opponentAt), player-vs-player rules (the server's pvp flag, the low-level shield, the
// level band, the `Aggressed` first-strike event) and `minKillSeconds`. Conventions as the rest of the game: heading h means forward = (sin h, cos h), aim = atan2(dx, dz). World owns mounting, rendering, animation and input.

 * The SERVER's plausibility bound for a kill report (there is no record to replay in Zone 1, so anti-cheat is a bound, not a proof): the fewest seconds a player could possibly take to kill `kind` at `level` with the WHOLE Pit kit.
 * The biggest blow is the kit's biggest base damage x the gear cap (CAPS.attack) x a held charge (RULES.charge) x the best situational multiplier (stop-hit, counter, rear on a downed target) x a landed Gambit; the fastest blow
 * and the fastest chained cycle come from the kit too. At a low level one such blow can kill, and then the bound is just the fastest windup: it only refuses a kill no kit could make. The special (20% of max health, a 2 s windup, a 20 s
 * cooldown) is never faster than blows, so it is not in the bound. The real protection is the server's spawn state, the single-use token and the per-account caps; this refuses only the impossible and never an honest fight.
